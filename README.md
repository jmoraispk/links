**Important**: This is not for you. It is for me. 
Here are some websites that I would like to remember. 
The links are ordered chronologically by time of visit, because I would like to remember that too.
Likewise, I want to remember how I found them and what I thought about them.

That's it. Enjoy.

- (Oct 4 2025) [pythonspeed](https://pythonspeed.com/): A blog about make python faster. After translating ~10k of Matlab to Python, and refactoring those lines to become 10x faster, I wondered about profilers. Perhaps my prints of time enlapsed could be improved. A quick Google search led me to a top-7 list, with cProfile in first, and a video of Itamar trash-talking it. Couldn't avoid clicking. Loved it. Googled him. Found his blog. My first post was also my favorite post: [330Ã— faster: Four different ways to speed up your code](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/different-ways-speed/). What HIT me is that he talks about PRACTICES. And while I was developing and refactoring, I wondered PRECISELY about what the right practice was. And he decouples optimization into 4 categories: efficiency (refactoring to reduce number of operations), compilation (using faster language), parallelization (using multiple processes), and development process (how to TRY to make the project faster, via benchmarking and understanding bottlenecks). It resonated. My second favorite post was [Jevons Paradox](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/software-jevons-paradox/). And onwards went I to learn about performance and memory profiling. A few videos later, there's no doubt Itamar is a bit crazy, which is only a sign that he truly is amazing at his craft. Now that I finally started this damn "link list", after [Rodrigo](https://mathspp.com/about) bothered me so much with [his](https://mathspp.com/link-blog). Let me read just 10 more Itamar posts, and call it a day.
